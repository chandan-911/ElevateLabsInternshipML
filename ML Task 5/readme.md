# ðŸŒ³ Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

This project implements **Task 5** of the **AI & ML Internship**, focusing on **tree-based classification models** using the **Heart Disease Dataset**. The solution includes training a **Decision Tree Classifier**, analyzing overfitting, implementing a **Random Forest Classifier**, interpreting **feature importances**, and evaluating model performance via **cross-validation**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Heart Disease Dataset**  
  Contains 13 features such as age, sex, cholesterol, etc., and a binary target variable:  
  - `0`: No heart disease  
  - `1`: Heart disease
